# Overview

This is an Application that allows you to view issues from different projects as a tree, table or roadmap

This application allows you, by using a JQL query, to view issues from different Jira projects in a tree, table or roadmap view. For example, you can have in a project a set of initiative issue-type, where each initiative is linked (with Issue Link or Parent Link) to epics located in other projects. So, first configure the link type used in the configuration section and then write a JQL query like the following in the portfolio section. This way you will see the initiatives and their epic daughters in the form of a tree, table and roadmap.

You can implement portfolio-oriented and project management frameworks such as Balanced-Scorecard, OKR (Objective Key Results), LVT (Lean Value Tree) or value tree.

The main features of the application are:

- Cross-project view.
- Filtering your query.
- Navigating the views.
- Issue hierarchy by Issue Links, Parent Link, Epic Link and subtasks.
- Table view.
- Cross-roadmap view.
